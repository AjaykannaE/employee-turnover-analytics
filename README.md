# Employee Turnover Analytics — Machine Learning Project

An end-to-end Machine Learning project focused on predicting employee attrition using HR analytics data.

## 📌 Problem Statement
To identify employees at risk of leaving and support proactive HR intervention strategies.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Quality Checks
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means Clustering of employees who left
- Handling Class Imbalance using SMOTE
- 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation
- Model Training & Comparison:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Probability-Based Risk Segmentation Framework

## 📊 Model Performance
- ROC-AUC ≈ 0.98 (Tuned Ensemble Models)
- High Recall for identifying employees likely to leave

## 🎯 Business Insight
Designed a 4-level risk segmentation model:
- Safe Zone
- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk

Each segment includes targeted retention strategy recommendations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
